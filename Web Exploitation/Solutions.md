- The first part of the flag is in the HTML source: ``picoCTF{ur_4_real_1nspe``
- The second part of the flag is in the mycss.css styling: ``ct0r_g4dget_098df0d0}``
- For some reason there specified third part in the JavaScript source was blank.

Client Side is Still Bad
========================
Site: http://2018shell3.picoctf.com:53990

As the title says, we are still playing with the client. Opening the inspector and looking at everything, there is a very interesting piece of JavaScript:
```JavaScript
function verify() {
    checkpass = document.getElementById("pass").value;
    split = 4;
    if (checkpass.substring(split*7, split*8) == '}') {
      if (checkpass.substring(split*6, split*7) == '0594') {
        if (checkpass.substring(split*5, split*6) == 'd_04') {
         if (checkpass.substring(split*4, split*5) == 's_ba') {
          if (checkpass.substring(split*3, split*4) == 'nt_i') {
            if (checkpass.substring(split*2, split*3) == 'clie') {
              if (checkpass.substring(split, split*2) == 'CTF{') {
                if (checkpass.substring(0,split) == 'pico') {
                  alert("You got the flag!")
                  }
                }
              }
      
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    else {
      alert("Incorrect password");
    }
  }
```
Take the pieces of the flag and assemble them.

Logon
=====
Site: http://2018shell3.picoctf.com:57252

You able to sign in with any username other than "admin".
If you view the cookies, there is one containing a boolean. Setting that to true and refreshing will yield the flag.

Irish Name Repo
===============
Site: http://2018shell3.picoctf.com:59464

The hint tells us everything we need to know. Let's drop a tautology on them.
```
a' OR '1' = '1'; --
```

Mr. Robots
==========
Site: http://2018shell3.picoctf.com:29568

There is a special .txt file that tells well-behaved crawlers that they should not be looking around at certain parts of the site, or the entire place itself.

Navigating to /robots.txt, we can see the following:
```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /74efc.html
```
Unfortunately for the webmaster, robots.txt really only applies to entities with a Lawful Good alignment. Navigating to the disallowed page we can get the flag.

Buttons
=======
Site: http://2018shell3.picoctf.com:18342

The first button seems to go well, but the second "button" takes us to a dead meme.

Looking at the links we go through, we seem to navigate to button1.php just fine, just to get redirected when we try to navigate to button2.php.

Button 1:
```HTML
<form action="button1.php" method="POST">
                        <input value="PUSH ME! I am your only hope!" type="submit">
                    </form>
```
Button 2:
```
<a href="button2.php">Button2</a>
```
Well there's a difference between a GET and a POST. Modifying the first button to point us to button2.php does the trick.

No Login
========
Site: http://2018shell3.picoctf.com:33889

I'm pretty damn sure that I'm not doing the Logon (four problems above) problem correctly since this one also seems to need cookie manipulation.

Upon pressing flag, the site looks for any cookie with the name 'admin', which can be generated using the Logon site problem by clicking the sign in button depending on how your browser behaves. Otherwise, Firefox seems to do a good job letting you make your own cookies.

Secret Agent
============
Site: http://2018shell3.picoctf.com:3827

Upon clicking the flag button, we are told that we aren't Google, followed by our user agent string.

A quick search to google asking about a "google user agent" yields us this page: https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/1061943?hl=en
from which we quote:

_"Crawler" is a generic term for any program (such as a robot or spider) used to automatically discover and scan websites by following links from one webpage to another. Google's main crawler is called Googlebot._

Using "Googlebot" as our user agent will grant us access to the flag.

The Vault
=========
Site: http://2018shell3.picoctf.com:49030

*Soooo, you want to hear another SQL injection huh? One where the very fate of PicoCTF hangs in the balance? If not, too bad. I'm telling you anyway.*

So we are given the PHP (disgusting) source code which happens to contain the SQL query. Completely unsecured, except for a validation check where it appears to be looking for the OR keyword using regex and rejecting the fields if found. Based on the given SQL query in the code through, we know the name of the table and the attribute the site works off of, so we can simply union whatever result the intended query gets with the entire table itself.
```
a' UNION SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE name='admin'; --
```
Well now that I look at it, the previous injection still works anyway if you put it in the password field.
```
a' OR '1' = '1'; --
```
I don't know if this was intended, but this is because they don't check the ``$password`` field for the ``OR`` SQL injection.
```PHP
$password_match = preg_match($pattern, $username); // oops. Should be $password here.
```
Either way, I always liked to put my injections in the password field anyway.
